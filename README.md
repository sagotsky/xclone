Quick and dirty pdf generation for card game tokens for prototyping a boardgame

Needed tokens for a board game project.  Pen and paper was too slow, especially when we were changing rules.  This is a first draft at specifying cards in cards.json, the location of their fields in layouts.json, and how many cards per deck in deck.json.  Oh yeah, this is also my first attempt at prawn.

Requires ruby plus the following gems:
* prawn
* prawn/measurement_extensions
* prawn/table
* json
